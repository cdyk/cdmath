# Unfancy and simple math library

This is a basic math library for computer graphics.

It is intentionally kept very simple to keep compile times down, as well as it should be completely obvious precisely what the code does with just a quick look at the code.

To use, insert include in your include path and add the cpp-file in source into your build.
